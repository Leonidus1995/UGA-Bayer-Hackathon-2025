Bayer’s challenge problem:
“Predicting future performance of particular lines in particular environments allows us to advance and optimize the best genetic material and target it towards specific areas without having to use excess resources. It is the spring of 2008, and you are a new data scientist who has been tasked with predicting performance of our Maize 110 pipeline. Using information from 2001–2007, we want you to predict the performance of anticipated crosses in selected testing sites. You may use the genetic information from the 2008 lines, and the location of the sites selected, but may not use either the performance of the lines in those areas, or 2008’s environment information (as neither of these things have happened yet).”
